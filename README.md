### Spellchecker for Nama language
#### Mikhneva Anna

The file with the main code: hunspell_test.py <br>
The file contains a morphoanalyzer converter into two files: a dictionary file and an affix file, with which it is possible to check the spelling of the Nama language in the Hunspell system. <br>
As the data I used morphoanalyzator.txt , into which the nama language morphoanalyzer, created by my colleague as a coursework, is copied in text format. <br>
Output data: nama.dic (dictionary) and nama.aff (affix file) files <br>
